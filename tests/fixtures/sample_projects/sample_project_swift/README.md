# Swift Sample Project

This is a sample Swift project for testing the CodeGraphContext Swift parser.

## Files

### Main.swift
- **Main** class with a `run()` method
- **Calculator** class with basic arithmetic operations
- Demonstrates class instantiation and method calls

### User.swift
- **Greeter** protocol defining a greeting interface
- **User** struct conforming to the Greeter protocol
- Extension on User struct adding additional functionality
- Demonstrates protocols, structs, and extensions

### Shapes.swift
- **Shape** protocol defining area and perimeter methods
- **Circle** class implementing Shape
- **Rectangle** struct implementing Shape
- **Triangle** class implementing Shape
- Demonstrates protocol conformance with multiple types

### Vehicles.swift
- **VehicleType** enum with different vehicle types
- **Result** enum with associated values (generic)
- **Vehicle** base class
- **Car** class inheriting from Vehicle
- Demonstrates enums, inheritance, and method overriding

### Generics.swift
- **Stack** generic class implementing a stack data structure
- Generic `swap` function
- **Container** protocol with associated type
- **IntCollection** struct conforming to Container
- Demonstrates Swift generics and protocols with associated types

## Features Tested

- ✅ Classes and structs
- ✅ Protocols and protocol conformance
- ✅ Enums (simple and with associated values)
- ✅ Inheritance
- ✅ Extensions
- ✅ Generics
- ✅ Functions and methods
- ✅ Initializers
- ✅ Properties
- ✅ Method calls
- ✅ Imports
