# Welcome to CodeGraphContext

CodeGraphContext (CGC) is a **Code Intelligence Engine**. It indexes your codebase into a graph database to provide deep semantic understanding for both developers (via CLI) and AI agents (via MCP).

### :material-console: For Developers (CLI)
Use powerful terminal commands to query call chains, find dependencies, and visual architectural graphs.
**[Explore CLI Reference](reference/cli_indexing.md)**

### :material-robot: For AI Agents (MCP)
Connect your codebase to Cursor, Claude, or VS Code. Let AI assist you with full context awareness.
**[Setup AI Assistant](guides/mcp_guide.md)** & 
**[Explore Natural Language Queries](reference/mcp_master.md)**

### ⚙️ Configuration
Customize databases, file limits, and more.

## 🏗️ Architecture

CGC sits between your code and your tools. It's not just a script; it's a persistent system.

## 🚀 Why CodeGraphContext?

*   **Cut Debugging Time:** Stop manually grepping. Find the exact root cause in seconds, not hours.
*   **Onboard Faster:** Help new developers understand complex logic without interrupting senior engineers.
*   **Reduce Technical Debt:** Identify dead code, circular dependencies, and "god objects" instantly.
